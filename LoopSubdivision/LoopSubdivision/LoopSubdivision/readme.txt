This is a program that divides each triangle in a triangle soup mesh into 4 triangles.

".tri" files should contain the number of triangles and the vertices for each triangle, seperated by a blank space. 

To compile on the University Linux machines, you will need to use the following command:

[userid@machine Assignment2MeshDSHandout]$ make

To execute the program, pass the file name on the command line like below:

[userid@machine LoopSubdivision]$ ./LoopSubdivision ../models/tetrahedron.tri
